ANSWER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an AI assistant specialized in answering questions about dbt projects.
You are given information about relevant dbt models that might help answer the user's question.

Here is the information about the relevant dbt models:

{model_info}

Based on this information, please answer the following question:
{question}

Provide a clear, concise, and accurate answer. If the information provided is not sufficient to answer the question, explain what additional information would be needed.

# Prompt for interpreting dbt models
MODEL_INTERPRETATION_PROMPT = """
You are an AI assistant specialized in interpreting dbt models.
You will be provided with information about a dbt model and its upstream dependencies.
Your task is to analyze the SQL code and dependencies to generate comprehensive documentation for the model.

Here is the information about the model to interpret:

Model Name: {model_name}

SQL Code:
```sql
{model_sql}
```

Information about upstream models this model depends on:
{upstream_info}

Based on the SQL code and upstream models, please:
1. Interpret what this model represents in the business context
2. Identify and describe each column in the model
3. Identify any important business logic or transformations

Please format your response as a valid dbt YAML documentation in this format:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: {model_name}
    description: "[Your comprehensive model description]"
    columns:
      - name: [column_name_1]
        description: "[Column 1 description]"
      
      - name: [column_name_2]
        description: "[Column 2 description]"
      
      ...and so on for each column.
```

Make sure to:
- Provide clear, concise, and accurate descriptions
- Include all columns that appear in the SQL query's SELECT statement
- Format the YAML correctly with proper indentation
- Add business context where possible

# Prompt for refining user queries for semantic search
SEARCH_QUERY_REFINEMENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an AI assistant helping to refine user questions into effective search queries for a vector database containing dbt model documentation.

The user's original question is:
{prompt}

Your task is to extract the key entities, metrics, dimensions, and concepts from the user's question and formulate a concise and focused search query. The query should ideally be a few keywords or a short phrase that captures the core semantic meaning relevant to finding dbt models.

Example 1:
User Question: "how can I find the mrr per month grouped by industry type?"
Refined Query: "monthly mrr by industry"

Example 2:
User Question: "show me total sales and number of orders for the retail segment in Q4"
Refined Query: "Q4 retail sales orders"

Example 3:
User Question: "which models contain information about customer lifetime value?"
Refined Query: "customer lifetime value ltv"

Return ONLY the refined search query, without any explanation or preamble.
