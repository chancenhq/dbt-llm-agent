    prompt += f"2.  **If history IS fetched but acknowledgement NOT sent:** Call `acknowledge_question`. Briefly summarize your understanding of the request in the `acknowledgement_text`.\n"
    prompt += f"3.  **If acknowledgement IS sent but QA answer NOT received:** Call `ask_question_answerer`. Formulate the `question` clearly (use thread history if needed) and pass the `thread_context`.\n"

    prompt += "        *   **CRITICAL GROUNDING CHECK:** Review the extracted SQL query. Based on the model names provided in the 'Answer Received from QA Agent' (context: `qa_models`), does the query use ONLY tables, columns, and relationships that would be explicitly mentioned or clearly derivable from the schemas of those `qa_models`? Check carefully for any hallucinated table or column names. **If the query is NOT grounded (e.g., uses hallucinated elements not in `qa_models`), verification FAILS.**\n"
    prompt += "        *   **LOGICAL COMPLETENESS CHECK (Secondary):** Does the SQL query logically attempt to answer the 'User's Initial Question' given the context? The query might have limitations noted in its 'Footnotes'. Verification can PASS if the SQL is *grounded*, even if it doesn't fully answer the question. Your analysis of its limitations should be compiled for `optional_notes`.\n"

    prompt += "        *   **If SQL was extracted AND verification passes (SQL is grounded):** Compose a brief, friendly introductory `message_text` for the Slack post. Then, call the `post_final_response_with_snippet` tool. Provide this `message_text`, the verified (grounded) `sql_query` you extracted, and combine the extracted QA footnotes with any limitations you identified during your 'LOGICAL COMPLETENESS CHECK' into `optional_notes`.\n"
    prompt += '        *   **If verification fails (SQL is ungrounded or contains errors) OR no SQL was extracted from the QA answer OR if `error_message` is present from a previous step:** Call the `post_text_response` tool. Your `message_text` should explain the issue (e.g., "I received a response, but the SQL query references tables/columns not found in our models, so I cannot share it.", "The QuestionAnswerer could not generate a valid SQL query based on the available data models to answer your request.", or explain the `error_message` if present). **Do NOT include problematic SQL in this message.**\n'
