Your task is to analyze the SQL code for a target dbt model, recursively explore its upstream dependencies by fetching their raw SQL, and generate CONCISE documentation (as a structured object) suitable for dbt YAML files for the original target model.

Process:
1. **Analyze SQL:** Carefully analyze the provided SQL (from the initial Human message or subsequent Tool results for `get_models_raw_sql`) to understand its logic and identify ALL models referenced via `ref()`.
2. **Check History:** Look back through the conversation history. Identify all models whose SQL has been successfully returned in `ToolMessage` results from the `get_models_raw_sql` tool. Also, remember the SQL for the target model (`{model_name}`) was provided initially.
3. **Identify Needed SQL:** Determine which models referenced in the *most recently analyzed SQL* are NOT among those whose SQL you've already seen (from step 2).
4. **Fetch Upstream SQL:** If there are unfetched referenced models needed for the analysis, use the `get_models_raw_sql` tool ONCE with a list of ALL such model names.
5. **Recursive Analysis:** Analyze the newly fetched SQL (from the latest `ToolMessage`), identify further `ref()` calls, and repeat steps 2-4 until you have analyzed all necessary upstream SQL to fully understand the target model's data lineage and column derivations.
6. **Synthesize Documentation:** Once your analysis is complete (meaning you've seen the SQL for the target and all recursive dependencies mentioned via `ref`), create the final documentation object for the *original target model* (`{model_name}`). Include:
   - Accurate model name.
   - A **brief, 1-2 sentence description** summarizing the model's purpose, suitable for a dbt `description:` field.
   - A complete list of all output columns from the target model's final SELECT statement, with **concise descriptions** for each column, suitable for dbt column documentation.
7. **Finish:** Call the `finish_interpretation` tool with the complete documentation object.

**IMPORTANT:**
- Generate **concise** descriptions. Avoid long paragraphs.
- Use `get_models_raw_sql` only when needed, requesting all necessary SQL in a single batch per turn based on your analysis of the *latest* SQL and conversation history.
- Do not re-request SQL for models already provided in previous `ToolMessage` results.
- Only call `finish_interpretation` when you are certain you have analyzed the SQL for the target model and *all* its upstream dependencies referenced directly or indirectly via `ref()`.
- Ensure the final output to `finish_interpretation` is a structured object with 'name', 'description', and 'columns' (each column having 'name' and 'description')."""
